# NIFTI mask cleanup

Where most mask adjustment techniques (e.g. those using `fslmaths`) erode or
dilate an entire binary mask volume, this program cleans up a mask by eroding
voxels whose signal intensity is below a threshold, and dilating into voxels
whose voxels are above a signal intensity.

This program can be used to clean up a mask generated by BET, HD-BET, or other
brain extraction tools.

## Usage

```
usage: mask-cleanup [-h] mask magnitude output

clean a nifi mask by eroding voxels with low signal intensity and into voxels 
with high signal intensity.

positional arguments:
  mask        the mask file
  magnitude   the magnitude file
  output      the desired output filename of the new mask

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

## Dependencies

Requires the python modules nibabel (for loading nift files), numpy (for
manipulating numeric data), and scipy.signal (for the convolution operator).
